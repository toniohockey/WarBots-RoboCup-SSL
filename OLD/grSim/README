This is an incomplete README file

*** Min System Requirements

grSim will likely run on a modern dual core PC running Ubuntu with good graphics card. Typical configuration is:

* Dual Core CPU (2.0 Ghz+)
* 1GB of RAM
* 256MB nVidia or ATI graphics card
* Ubuntu Linux 9.10+ 

*** INSTALLATION

We developed grSim on Ubuntu 9.10+ OS. (Ubuntu 11.04 tested and is recommended)

1. It is very important that the Graphics Card Driver is installed. (Ubuntu packages of nVidia and AMD(ATI) graphics cards are available)
2. Install the dependencies

sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev g++ build-essential libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev

3. Extract the grSim archive into a folder

cd grSim
qmake
make

the binary file will be in grSim/bin [Check the fps in status bar, if it is running on 65fps everything is ok, otherwise check the graphics card installation and OpenGL settings. If you received linker error about GL related libraries, also check your graphics card driver.

*** USAGE

Receiving data from grSim is exactly like receiving from SSL-Vision (http://code.google.com/p/ssl-vision) using Google Protobuf library
Sending data to Simulator is also possible using Google Protobuf. A sample client is included in "client" folder. The compilation procedure is like grSim itself.

*** Credits

grSim uses these libraries:

Nokia Qt 4.6+ (development libraries will be installed with libqt4-dev)
OpenGL (development libraries will be installed with libqt4-dev)
Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) - Included 
VarTypes Library - Included
Google ProtoBuf - Included
